# 28 Frags Later
## Overview

This is a [Grand Theft Auto V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_V) Mod written in C# loosely based on the popular post-apocalyptic zombie film titled ['28 Days Later'](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289043/). The Mod adds an additional set of missions to the GTAV single player game for PC.

## Synopsis

**Day 1 - Exposure**:
A group of missguided animal liberation activists break into the [Humane medical research laboratory](http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/Humane_Labs_and_Research), unaware that the animals are infected with a highly contagious [rage-inducing virus](http://28dayslater.wikia.com/wiki/Rage_Virus). After breaking out the animals, the virus quickly spreads across the surrounding rural area, wiping out the entire population nearby towns.

**Day 3 - Infection**:
Just a few days after the Humane laboratory is breached, news of a virus spreading across [Blaine County](http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/Blaine_County) causes mass panic. Emergency services are stretched and riots soon break out.

**Day 8 - Epidemic**:
After the [Military](http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/Military) is deployed on the streets to keep the peace, official advice is to stay indoors, but not everyone has the same idea.

**Day 15 - Evacuation**:
A safe zone is setup and maintained around [Los Santos International Airport](http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/Los_Santos_International_Airport_(HD_Universe)). Allowing [Titan](http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/Titan) aircrafts to line up on the tarmac for intimidate evacuation of the city... "Please walk to the exit in an orderly fashion".

**Day 20 - Devastation**:
With people either fleeing or infected, the [Palmer-Taylor Power Station](http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/Palmer-Taylor_Power_Station) shut down for the first time in over... well, a few days... plunging the remaining citizens into total darkness.

**Day 28 - Alone**:
...

## Gameplay
Each 'day' acts as a mission which follows the story of a differant person's journey during the virus outbreak.

## History

A keen web developer who wanted to get his hands dirty in game design back in 2004, I took to scripting custom multi-player game types for EA Games' [Medal of Honor: Allied Assault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor:_Allied_Assault). Built on top of the [QuakeIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Tech_3#Games_using_a_proprietary_license) engine with locked down source code, MOH:AA allowed the creation of a basic ['28 Frags Later'](https://github.com/dazrave/MOHAA-28FragsLater) but just didn't portray the storyline desired. Until now, over 10 years later.

## Installation

To be completed upon release of mod.

## Disclaimer

I've never scripted anything in C# before nor am I an expert using Visual Studio. This script is also the very first time I've attempted
to mod GTA, ever.

Therefore it's probably quite roughly cut code. I take no responsibility for your game crashing. If you're having trouble installing the mod, I will try my hardest to help with the limited knowledge I have.

## Usage

Feel free to use any of my code where ever you please. Rip it apart, rebuild it. Make more missions to share with others. Enjoy the missions I have made. So long as my work is providing more life to the ever amazing GTA franchise of games, I'm a happy modder.
